# Embedding-based Audio-text Retrieval Module

This part is based on the code of [On Metric Learning for Audio-Text Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://github.com/XinhaoMei/audio-text_retrieval). Please refer to their repository for details on environment setting-up. The settings we use are `settings/settings_beatstf.yaml` and `settings/settings_beatstf_ac.yaml`. The script is ``bart_train.py``.
